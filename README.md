# Data Transformation:

Data Transformation was done in excel.
I added two additional columns named 'All Landing Pages' and 'Month' next to the 'Months'  columns respectively. Once the cleaning was done i validated each column from
'All Landing Pages' to 'Transactions' columns and made a table.
For more see 'Transformed Data' file above.
